            <p class="title">Hockey in Sports Arena</p> <br>
            <p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5sYi58NCZRfzHosINC/giphy.gif" class="wrap" alt="">
                Hockey is a team sport played on ice, where two teams compete to score goals by hitting a small
                puck with a stick into the opposing team's net. It is a popular sport played worldwide, especially
                in Canada, the United States, Russia, and Europe. The sport's popularity stems from its fast-paced,
                physical gameplay and the intense rivalry between teams.
                The sport is played in an arena, also known as a rink, that is 200 feet long and 85 feet wide. The
                playing surface is made of ice, and the rink is surrounded by boards and glass to keep the puck in
                play. There are two goals on opposite ends of the rink, and each team defends one goal while trying
                to score in the other.
                Hockey is played with six players on each team, including a goalie. The game begins with a faceoff,
                where the two centermen from each team stand in the center circle and try to win possession of the
                puck. Once a team has the puck, they try to move it up the ice and into the opposing team's zone,
                where they can set up scoring opportunities.
                The game is divided into three periods, each lasting 20 minutes, with a 15-minute intermission between
                periods. If the game is tied at the end of regulation, there is a sudden-death overtime period, where
                the first team to score wins the game. If no one scores in overtime, the game ends in a tie, or in some
                cases, goes to a shootout, where each team takes turns shooting at the opposing goalie to determine a
                winner.
                Hockey is a physically demanding sport that requires skill, speed, and endurance. Players must be able
                to skate quickly, maneuver the puck with their sticks, and avoid physical contact from opposing players.
                Checking, or body contact, is allowed in hockey, making it a physical sport where players can use their
                bodies to gain an advantage.
                In addition to physicality, hockey also requires mental toughness and strategy. Coaches and players must
                make quick decisions about when to make line changes, call timeouts, and adjust their game plan to adapt
                to the opposing team's style of play.
                Hockey has a rich history and culture that has evolved over time. The sport's origins can be traced back
                to Canada in the late 19th century, where it was initially played on frozen ponds and lakes. Since then,
                the sport has grown and become more organized, with professional leagues, international tournaments, and
                the Olympics.
                The NHL (National Hockey League) is the premier professional league in North America, featuring 32 teams
                from the United States and Canada. The league's popularity has led to the creation of minor leagues,
                such
                as the AHL (American Hockey League) and ECHL (East Coast Hockey League), which serve as development
                leagues
                for young players.
                Internationally, hockey is played at the highest level in tournaments such as the World Championships,
                the World Cup of Hockey, and the Olympics. These tournaments showcase the best players from around the
                world
                and provide an opportunity for countries to compete against each other on the ice.
                Hockey has also inspired a culture of fandom and tradition, with fans displaying their support for their
                favorite teams through jerseys, hats, and other memorabilia. The sport has also produced iconic moments,
                such as the "Miracle on Ice" at the 1980 Olympics, where the United States defeated the heavily favored
                Soviet Union team.
                In conclusion, hockey is a dynamic and exciting sport that is played in arenas all over the world. It
                requires skill, physicality, and strategy, making it a demanding but rewarding sport for players and
                fans alike. With its rich history and culture, hockey is sure to remain a beloved sport for years to
                come.
